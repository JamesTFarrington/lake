# Clake - Clake is a [Rake](https://github.com/ruby/rake)-like program implemented in Common Lisp.
[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/Rudolph-Miller/clake.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Rudolph-Miller/clake)

## API

See [Document](https://rudolph-miller.github.io/clake/overview.html).  
This HTML is generated by [Codex](https://github.com/CommonDoc/codex).

## Current design policy

For now following after rake against preceding GNU make.

## API design exploration

Here shows some API design examples.

    ;; Do the default task for Clakefile in the current directory.
    (clake:clake)
    
    ;; Do a task specifying its name for Clakefile in the current directory.
    (clake:clake "hello")
    
    ;; Do a task in namespace.
    (clake:clake "hello:say")
    
    ;; Also do a file task in namespace.
    (clake:clake "hello:hello")
    
    ;; Shell command interface is provided for convenience.
    (clake:sh "pwd") 

## Clakefile design exploration

Here shows what and how Clakefile should express.

    ;; A task that print hello.
    (clake:deftask "hello" ()
      (print "do task hello!")
      (terpri))

    ;; Tasks that build an executable with dependency.
    (defparameter cc "gcc")
    
    (clake:deffile "hello" ("hello.o" "message.o")
      (sh #?"#{cc} -o hello hello.o message.o"))
    
    (clake:deffile "hello.o" ("hello.c")
      (sh #?"#{cc} -c hello.c"))

    (clake:deffile "message.o" ("message.c")
      (sh #?"#{cc} -c message.c"))

    (clake:deftask "clean" ()
      (sh "rm -f hello hello.o message.o"))

    ;; The "all" task.
    (clake:deftask "all" ("hello" "som"))
    
    (clake:deffile "hello" ("hello.c")
      (sh #?"#{cc} -o hello hello.c"))
    
    (clake:deffile "som" ("som.c")
      (sh #?"#{cc} -o som som.c"))

    ;; Namespaces
    (clake:with-namespace "hello"
    
      ;; TBD: How should depencency in a namespace behave?
      ;;      Does this "hello" dependency refer a task only in "hello" namespace?
      (clake:deftask "say" ("hello")
        (sh "./hello"))
      
      (clake:deffile "hello" ("hello.c")
        (sh #?"#{cc} -o hello hello.c"))
      
      ;; A file task should depend on only file tasks, not on tasks.
      (clake:deffile "hello.o" ("say")
        (sh "false")))

    ;; Can't use colons in a task name because they are reserved for namespace delimiter.
    (clake:deftask "hel:lo" ())
    
    ;; Make a directory.
    (clake:defdirectory "some/directory")

## Task kinds

There are some kinds of "Task" representing a sequence of shell commands.

|Name|Clakefile|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Task|deftask|This represents a base concept processing a sequence of shell commands.|
|File task|deffile|This represents a task resolving file dependency with up-to-date check.|
|Directory task|defdirectory|Make a directory.|

## Design requirements
- dynamic task definition
- expected number of tasks in a Clakefile is ~100
- up-to-date check
- duplicated task names allowed, executed respectively
- make(1)'s internal macros
- ros interface
- modularity
- parallel task execution
