## API design exploration

Here shows some API design examples.

    ;; Do the default task for CLAKEFILE in the current directory.
    (clake:clake)
    
    ;; Do a task specifying its name for CLAKEFILE in the current directory.
    (clake:clake :hello)

## CLAKEFILE design exploration

Here shows what and how CLAKEFILE should express.

```common-lisp
;; A task that print hello.
(clake:deftask :hello
  (print "do task hello!")
  (terpri))

;; A task that build an executable with object file depencency.
(defparameter cc "gcc")
(clack:deffile "hello" ("hello.o" "message.o")
  (sh #?"#{cc} -o hello hello.o message.o"))
```

## Design requirements
- dynamic task definition
